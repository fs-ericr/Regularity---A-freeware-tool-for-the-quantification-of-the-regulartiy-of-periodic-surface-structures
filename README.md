# ReguΛarity

## ReguΛarity – A freeware tool for the objective quantification of the regularity of periodic surface structures

ReguΛarity is an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) application designed for scientists and researchers that allows users to quickly and accurately quantify the regularity of periodic structures on material surfaces using image-based analytical methods.

---

## Key Features

- **Intuitive GUI:** Simple, user-friendly interface for fast processing and analysis.
- **Image Processing:** Supports common image formats (JPG, PNG, TIF, TIFF).
- **Regularity Quantification:** Implements robust analytical methods, including Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), the Calculation of the DLOA (Dispersion of the LIPSS Orientation Angle), the P³S-method, and Gini coefficient calculations.
- **Data Output:** Results are saved clearly structured in Excel-compatible formats (.xlsx).
