# ReguΛarity

## A freeware software for quantifying the regularity of periodic surface structures

ReguΛarity is an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) application designed for scientists and researchers working in the fields of laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS), surface pattern analysis, and materials science. The software allows users to quickly and accurately quantify the regularity of periodic structures on material surfaces using image-based analytical methods.

## Key Features

- **Intuitive GUI:** Simple, user-friendly interface for fast processing and analysis.
- **Image Processing:** Supports common image formats (JPG, PNG, TIF, TIFF).
- **Regularity Quantification:** Implements robust analytical methods, including Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), the Calculation of the DLOA (Dispersion of the LIPSS Orientation Angle), the P³S-method, and Gini coefficient calculations.
- **Data Output:** Results are saved clearly structured in Excel-compatible formats (.xlsx).
